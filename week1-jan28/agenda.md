### mobile app mind map

- Download a brand new app from the app store; one that you've never used

- As you go through the process, make note of your user experience
  - what do you think about the process?
  - what was smooth, what was slow?
  - what animations were good?
  - what text was displayed and did it make sense?
  - color schemes that you liked?
  - permission popups?
  - tutorials good or bad?
- Should aim to have 15-20 different thoughts mapped out for the interaction
- Submit mind-map via Canvas
